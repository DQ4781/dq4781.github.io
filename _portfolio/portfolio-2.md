### Project Overview

In the face of rapid global spread of infectious diseases, timely and efficient surveillance is crucial. Our project developed a modular, open-source, GIS-enabled web-based dashboard and mobile app designed to enhance the surveillance capabilities for Mpox outbreaks. This tool allows public health officials to monitor epidemiological patterns in real time, providing critical data that aids in early containment and effective intervention.

### Objectives

- **Enhance Surveillance**: Implement a dynamic surveillance system to track and visualize the progression of Mpox outbreaks.
- **Real-Time Data Utilization**: Use real-time data to inform public health responses and interventions effectively.
- **Accessibility for NGOs**: Create a tool that non-governmental and community-based organizations can easily adapt and use in different regions.

### Key Features

- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes Python and the Streamlit library to present interactive GIS maps, charts, and other crucial metrics.
- **Adaptability**: Designed to monitor any infectious disease by adjusting the input data, making it a versatile tool for various public health scenarios.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers a clean and intuitive interface for users to interact with complex epidemiological data without requiring advanced technical skills.

### Achievements

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Enabled monitoring of the 2022 Mpox outbreak in the United States, demonstrating the platform's capability in real-world scenarios.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Provided interactive visual tools that help in identifying hotspots and trends, essential for rapid response and decision-making.
- **Community Impact**: Offered an effective surveillance model that can be adopted by organizations with limited resources, particularly in low to middle-income countries.

### Impact

This project not only advanced the technological approach to disease surveillance but also provided a scalable model that can be adapted across different geographical and socio-economic settings. By facilitating early detection and continuous monitoring of disease outbreaks, it contributes to global health security and disease management.

### Future Directions

We plan to expand the functionality of the surveillance system by incorporating machine learning models to predict outbreak trends and potential hotspots. The aim is to provide even more robust tools that can preemptively alert health authorities about possible outbreaks, enhancing the proactive capabilities of public health systems.
