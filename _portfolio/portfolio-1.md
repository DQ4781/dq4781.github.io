### Overview

In response to the ongoing challenge of managing infectious diseases such as Lassa Fever (LF), our study leverages advanced machine learning techniques to predict and analyze the determinants influencing LF outbreaks in Nigeria. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2012 to 2019, we applied **XGBoost** and **Random Forest** models to identify and quantify the socio-economic, eco-climatic, and spatiotemporal factors that most significantly impact LF incidence rates.

### Objectives

- **Assess and rank**: Evaluate various factors including healthcare infrastructure, population demographics, and environmental conditions to understand their roles in influencing disease spread.
- **Predictive accuracy**: Achieve high predictive accuracy in forecasting LF outbreaks to enable preemptive public health interventions.
- **Feature importance analysis**: Utilize SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the contributions of individual predictors, offering insights into the complex interplay of factors driving LF outbreaks.

### Key Achievements

- **Model performance**: Achieved a model accuracy of up to 0.93, AUC of 0.90, and an F1 score of 0.86 with XGBoost, surpassing traditional analysis methods.
- **Influential predictors**: Identified key predictors such as precipitation seasonality and diagnostic center density, which are crucial for targeted public health strategies.
- **Public health insights**: Provided valuable insights that can inform the development of an advanced early warning system for LF in Nigeria, potentially reducing the impact of future outbreaks.

### Impact

This project not only advanced the field of computational epidemiology but also set the stage for implementing data-driven health interventions in regions most affected by Lassa Fever. The ability to accurately predict and understand the nuances of LF outbreaks empowers public health officials to allocate resources effectively and enact policies that are informed by robust scientific analysis.

### Future Directions

Building on the success of this project, future work will aim to incorporate real-time data and expand the modelâ€™s predictive capabilities to other regions and diseases. The ultimate goal is to develop a universally adaptable model that can serve as a cornerstone for global disease surveillance and management systems.
